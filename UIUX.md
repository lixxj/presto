# UI/UX Overview of Presto Presentation Application

## Introduction

This document outlines the UI/UX design decisions made in the development of the Presto Presentation Application. The application aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience when creating, managing, and viewing presentations.

## Navigation Bar

### Rationale
The navigation bar is a cornerstone of the user interface, providing easy access to the various functionalities of the application. It has been designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, with a focus on displaying only the information that is necessary for the user's current context.

### Design Features
- **Contextual Display:** Only the relevant options are shown, reducing cognitive load and enhancing focus.
- **Logout Option:** Positioned distinctly on the right, ensuring users can quickly find the option to secure their session after use.

## Presentation List

### Rationale
Presentation management should be straightforward and hassle-free. This presentation list offers a visual cue that helps users quickly identify their work.

### Design Features
- **Identifiable Thumbnails:** Includes a snapshot of the presentation's content user can upload, making it easy to visually search for a specific project.
- **Consistent Information Layout:** Each presentation card displays the presentation title, a brief description, and the number of slides, offering essential information at a glance.

## Dark/Light Mode Toggle

### Rationale
User comfort is paramount, and the inclusion of theme toggling respects individual preferences for screen brightness, which can vary based on ambient lighting conditions or personal sensitivity.

### Design Features
- **Accessibility:** Located in the footer for consistent access, the toggle enables users with different visual needs to customize the interface according to their preference.
- **Memory Feature:** The selected mode persists throughout the session and on subsequent visits, reflecting a personalized experience.

## Presentation Editing Interface

### Rationale
Editing presentations should feel intuitive and uncluttered, providing tools as they are needed without overwhelming the user.

### Design Features
- **Minimalist Tool Options:** The tools for adding text, images, videos, and code are neatly arranged, promoting a clean workspace and preventing decision fatigue.
- **Slide Navigation:** Clear 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons enable easy navigation between slides, coupled with a counter for reference.

## UI/UX Improvements

Throughout the development process, continuous iterations have been made to the UI/UX to enhance user satisfaction and application efficiency:

1. **Thumbnail Feedback:** Initially, thumbnails lacked descriptive content, leading to confusion. We added titles and slide counts to mitigate this.
2. **Contrast Optimization:** The color palette was adjusted for better contrast, facilitating readability and reducing eye strain.
3. **Responsive Design:** Improvements were made to ensure the application is fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on various devices and screen sizes.
4. **User Testing:** We conducted several rounds of user testing to refine the UI elements based on direct feedback.

## Conclusion

The UI/UX design of the Presto Presentation Application is a product of thoughtful design choices, user feedback, and a commitment to continuous improvement. Our design philosophy places the user's needs at the forefront, aiming to deliver a product that is not only functional but also a joy to use.

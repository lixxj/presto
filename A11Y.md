# Accessibility Features in Presto Presentation Application

## Introduction

This document details the accessibility features implemented in the Presto Presentation Application. Our goal is to ensure that our application is usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. We follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and have incorporated several key accessibility features that can be seen directly in the application's user interface.

## Semantic HTML Use

### Rationale
Semantic HTML is crucial for accessibility as it provides meaningful structure to web content, making it easier to navigate and understand for users with assistive technologies.

### Implementation
- **Use of HTML5 structural elements**: We utilize `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` to define the document structure clearly.
- **Content Sectioning**: Using `<section>` and `<article>` tags, we provide landmarks for easier navigation and comprehension.

## Color Contrast

### Rationale
High contrast between text and background is essential for users with visual impairments to read content without strain.

### Implementation
- **Contrast Ratio**: We adhere to WCAG AA standard contrast ratios for text and background colors to ensure legibility.
- **Color Choices**: Our design avoids color combinations that are known to be problematic for those with color vision deficiencies.

## Dark and Light Mode

### Rationale
The ability to switch between dark and light mode allows users to choose the most comfortable viewing experience, which is especially helpful for reducing eye strain.

### Implementation
- **Toggle Feature**: A toggle switch is provided in the footer, allowing users to switch between dark and light mode based on their preference or environmental conditions.
- **Persistence**: User's choice of mode is remembered during the session and on subsequent visits to provide a consistent experience.

## Conclusion

The Presto Presentation Application is designed with accessibility in mind. We continue to evaluate and improve our application to ensure it meets and exceeds accessibility standards, thus providing an inclusive environment for all users. Future updates will include further enhancements based on user feedback and advances in accessibility guidelines.
